# How to get the listing state in Axie Infinity Contracts (a.k.a: listingState, getListingState)

Are you looking for the ABI, method and address to get the listingState so you can auto-buy in Axie Infinity? 100% on chain, no GraphQL. Well, it will not be cheap as it took a lot of research and debug from me but you can contact me on Discord if you’re willing to pay what is worth (10.000 USD): SmartContractsDebugger#5274
Proofs?
I can provide you an endpoint with low latency and no rate limit so you can be sure that you’re not querying a GraphQL proxy. After payment I’ll send to you the ABI, the method and the contract address to get it on chain.
